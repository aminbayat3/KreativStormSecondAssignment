Before contributing, please make sure to follow these guidelines and steps to ensure smooth collaboration.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Clone the Project**: 
   - Use `git clone <repository-url>` to clone the project to your local machine.

2. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   - Run `git pull` to make sure your `main` branch is up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository.

3. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Run `git checkout -b <name-of-your-branch>` to create a new branch where you will make your changes. 

4. **Work on Your Branch**:
   - Implement your changes on this new branch.
   -  Once you're done with the changes, run `git add .` to stage all the modified files.
   - Commit your changes locally using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

5. **Push Your Branch**:
   - Push your branch to the remote repository with `git push origin <name-of-your-branch>`.

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and create a new pull request.
   - Make sure your pull request compares your branch against the `main` branch.
   - Add a description of the changes you've made and assign me(Amin) as a reviewer.

7. **Review Process**:
   - Once the pull request is approved, you can merge your changes into the `main` branch.
  
## Next Steps

1. **Switch Back to the Main Branch**:
   - After your pull request is merged, switch back to the `main` branch with `git checkout main`.

2. **Update Your Local Main Branch**:
   - Run `git pull` to get the latest changes from the remote `main` branch. This ensures your local `main` branch is up to date.

3. **Create a New Branch for the Next Task**:
   - Run `git checkout -b <new-task-branch>`
