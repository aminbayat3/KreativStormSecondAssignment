## Project: HeavyMachinery Website

### Introduction
This project is a static website for **HeavyMachinery**, designed to showcase the services, machines, and contact information of a construction company. The website consists of several pages, including **Home**, **Services**, **Machines**, and **Contact** pages, each providing valuable information to potential customers.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Semantic Structure**:  
  We followed semantic coding practices by using meaningful tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` to organize content. Instead of relying solely on `<div>`, we incorporated `<ul>` and `<li>` elements for lists to ensure proper content structure.

- **ARIA Labels**:  
  To enhance accessibility for screen readers and improve SEO, we used ARIA labels on interactive elements and links to ensure a more inclusive user experience.

- **Folder Structure**:  
  The project adopts a clear folder structure, with a **global** folder containing styles such as resets, boilerplate CSS, and shared components like the header and footer. Additionally, a `utils.css` file is used to apply the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle by defining reusable common classes across pages.

- **CSS Variables**:  
  CSS variables were utilized for consistent colors and font management throughout the website, simplifying the styling process and allowing for easier adjustments.

- **CSS Functions**:  
  We implemented the `clamp()` function to achieve responsive font sizes that adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring optimal readability on devices ranging from desktop to mobile.

- **Responsiveness**:  
  The website is fully responsive and adjusts perfectly for:
  - **Desktop**: 1024px and above
  - **Laptops**: 768px and above
  - **Tablets**: 480px and above
  - **Mobile Devices**: Less than 480px

- **Class Naming**:  
  Although the project does not use a popular naming convention like BEM, we ensured that class names are clear, specific, and understandable, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend.
